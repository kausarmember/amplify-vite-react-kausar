## 1. Project Overview

The application is a web app that allows employees to report how the temperature feels at their workspace (“Too Cold”, “Comfortable”, or “Too Warm”). The app aggregates this feedback and displays it on a heatmap-style dashboard so Facilities Management (FM) can quickly identify problem areas across the office.

---

The application is for:
- Office workers – to report comfort levels quickly and receive suggestions for more comfortable areas.
- Facilities Management (FM) – to monitor temperature issues across floors/zones using real-time data.
- Senior Leadership (SLT) – to understand workplace comfort trends and improve office utilisation.

---

The office experiences inconsistent temperatures across floors and zones, but FM receives complaints informally and without structure. This leads to repeated issues, slow response times, and inefficient use of workspace. The application provides real, usable data so FM can act proactively and staff can work more comfortably.
