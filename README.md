## 1. Project Overview

OfficeClimate is a web app that allows employees to report how the temperature feels at their workspace (“Too Cold”, “Comfortable”, or “Too Warm”). The app aggregates this feedback and displays it on a heatmap-style dashboard so Facilities Management (FM) can quickly identify problem areas across the office.

### Target Users
- **Office Workers** – submit comfort reports quickly and receive suggestions for more suitable seating areas.  
- **Facilities Management (FM)** – monitor temperature issues across floors/zones using real-time aggregated data.  
- **Senior Leadership (SLT)** – understand workplace comfort trends and improve office utilisation.

### Problem Addressed
The office experiences inconsistent temperatures across floors and zones, and FM currently receives complaints informally and without structure. This results in:
- Repeated, unresolved comfort issues  
- Slow FM response times  
- Reduced employee satisfaction  
- Inefficient workspace utilisation  

OfficeClimate solves this by providing structured, actionable data that allows FM to act proactively while improving the experience of staff working on-site.
